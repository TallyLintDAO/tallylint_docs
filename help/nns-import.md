# NNS Import

{% hint style="info" %}
**Option:** There are a total of two options for introducing neurons
{% endhint %}

## Use Hotkey

### Description:&#x20;

With Hotkey, it is possible to import your neuronal information automatically.

**Necessary Note:** This will authorise our website certain permissions to operate your neurons.

Don't worry though, we only get this access if you log into our site via **Internet Identity**.&#x20;

We do not gain any access per se, nor do we manipulate your neurons.

### Step:&#x20;

1. Log in NNS ([https://nns.ic0.app/](https://nns.ic0.app/))
2. Selection of neurons to be counted
3.  Click **Add Hotkey**

4. Enter the **Principal ID** in TaxLint.

## Use Neuron Account

### Description:&#x20;

Each neuron has a Neuron Account, through which neuron extraction records can be imported automatically.

There is **no theoretical risk** in this operation

### **Step:**

1. Log in NNS ([https://nns.ic0.app/](https://nns.ic0.app/))
2. Selection of neurons to be counted
3.  Find **Neuron** **Account** and copy it
