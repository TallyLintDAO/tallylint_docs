# ðŸ’¡ What we do

### Decentralised, Private, Secure

When using regular virtual currency tax statistics platforms, there are often concerns about whether such centralised platforms can meet the privacy requirements of compliant web3 users. TaxLint is a **100% on-chain decentralised** application and we are committed to providing users with a private, secure web3 tax service.

### Auto Tax Report

TaxLint is dedicated to reducing the cost of time and improving the user experience of cryptocurrencies on the Internet Computer.&#x20;

Through automation and smart contracts deployed on-chain, TaxLint removes the need for users to manually tally their taxes and automatically exports their tax returns at the click of a mouse.
